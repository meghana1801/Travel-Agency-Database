# Travel-Agency-Database
This project aims at creating a database for a private travel agency to store information about the clients and agents. Information regarding them such as first name, last name, contact details (email, contact number), salary, commission percentages, ratings (of agents), agent allotted if any, reservation if any (for the client). In case the client has already booked a vacation, information about the agent allotted(if any) reservation date, return trip date, destination, and charges will be stored.

The agency also keeps track of locations served by agency. A user can choose to mention their destination, vacation start date and end date. The reservations made will contain a list of hotels booked by the user, in turn, the locations.  There will be a list of hotels in partnership with the agency around the area along with their price, location, and ratings.
